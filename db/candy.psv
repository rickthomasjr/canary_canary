Most of us at CandyWarehouse grew up learning that Pluto was the ninth planet in our solar system. In 2006, that all changed. Because of its small stature in relations to its siblings Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and so forth, Pluto’s prime planet status was revoked by scientists and it was sent down to the dwarf planet class where it dwells among over 40 other similarly-sized known galaxy objects. We love tiny things with big impacts around here, and that’s why we’re over the moon about these Petite Striped Candy Balls. These itty bitty confections are big tasty beauties decorated with perfectly rendered yellow and white stripes and a fabulous banana flavor. Pluto’s surface is believed to be rocky, unlike these super smooth yellow and white baby balls. Individually wrapped for freshness, these fruity balls shine brightly in our sugary inventory.

2800|Batman 9-Inch Tall Gumball Dispenser|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>Each Batman movie that Christopher Nolan created centers on a theme that can be summed up in one word. Recently the filmmaker was quoted as stating that 2005's <em>Batman Begins</em> is about ""fear"" while 2008's <em>The Dark Knight</em> operates with ""chaos,"" and 2012's <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> focuses on ""pain."" Pretty weighty subjects, but no one ever characterized Nolan's noir-ish vision of this crime-fighter on the big screen as being light and breezy. We wouldn't change a thing about the movies, but we're thankful there are fun ways to keep the Man in Black's adventures alive long after his story ends--this cool Batman-themed gumball dispenser is one sweet way. Boldly decorated boxes with images of the Marvel Comics superhero contain a modern iteration of the iconic gumball machines of old.

2717|Blue Sassy Cylinders Striped Candy: 5LB Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>Before being made obsolete by the superior disc-shaped gramophone record system, music was recorded and reproduced on wax cylinders containing special grooves. Invented in 1877, Thomas Edison’s phonograph cylinder allowed listeners to enjoy about 100 spins of a particular piece of music on these cylinders before the ""record"" wore down and the wax had to be smoothed over and imprinted with new music-playing grooves. Imagine carting boxes of cylinders around in order to listen to your favorite tunes instead of an iPod! Technology has come a long way since then, but we’re delighted to see that now cylinders can be enjoyed in a more practical and efficient way: as a delicious fruity blueberry candy snack. These uniquely shaped confections transmit bold blueberry flavor to your taste buds via thick blue and white candy stripes, and each capsule of sweetness makes a strong impression on all your senses with just one gander, whiff, lick and crunch. Long-lasting hard candy goodness is kept fresh with individual wrappers, making these adorably tasty treats perfect when kept in a bowl for guests to sample. You’ll see smiles all around when you have these Sassy Cylinders on hand!<br><br> There are approximately 60 pieces per pound.<br><br><strong>Cylinder Specifications-</strong><br> Length: 1 Inch<br> Width: 1/2 Inch<br> Net Weight: 7 Grams<br> Flavor: Blueberry<br><br> Unit Price = $3.90/lb.<br><br> Bag contains 5 pounds of Blue Sassy Cylinders Striped Candy.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Hard Candy|http://canary.dev/products/2717|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/sassy-cylinders-blue-131531-im.jpg|19.5||Y|1|1975-07-09 14:40:18
2469|Blue Sassy Suckers Striped Ball Lollipops: 100-Piece Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>In 2010, an amateur astronomer snapped a shot of the giant gaseous planet Jupiter that revealed an astronomical mystery: Jupiter has lost one of its biggest colored stripes! Made of different colored clouds, the stripes have been a mainstay since first observed in 1979, and the recent disappearance of one of the boldest belts is a dramatic galactic shift that has sky-watchers puzzled. We love Jupiter for its deep, candy-colored stripes, and that may explain why we’re over the moon about these sizable Striped Ball suckers. Lined with bright blue and white stripes, these tasty candies are long-lasting snacks with a beauty that’s all their own. Curved blue lines stretch across the hard candy’s surface (just like Jupiter’s banded outer layer), and meet in the centers on the left and right sides. A handy 3-inch stick makes this confection a perfect treat for getting your sweet fix on the go, and a vibrant blueberry taste gives you even more to get excitedly worked up over. We don’t know when or if Jupiter will get its lost stripe back, but we’ve got the perfect fruity treat to distract you while you wait!<br><br><strong>Sucker Specifications-</strong><br> Diameter: 1 Inch<br> Total Length: 4 Inches<br> Net Weight: 22 Grams<br> Flavor: Blueberry<br><br> Unit Price = $0.20/piece.<br><br> Bag contains 100 Blue Sassy Suckers Striped Ball Lollipops.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Lollipops and Suckers|http://canary.dev/products/2469|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/Sassy-pops-blue-131509-im2.jpg|20.0||Y|2|1996-07-11 23:20:56

2565|Blueberry Sassy Spheres Blue Striped Petite Candy Balls: 5LB Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>The celestial body Pluto appears bright in our night sky because its icy surface reflects the sun’s rays. Most of us at CandyWarehouse grew up learning that Pluto was the ninth planet in our solar system. In 2006, that all changed. Because of its small stature in relations to its siblings Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and so forth, Pluto’s prime planet status was revoked by scientists and it was sent down to the dwarf planet class where it dwells among over 40 other similarly-sized known galaxy objects. We love tiny things with big impacts around here, and that’s why we’re over the moon about these Petite Striped Candy Balls. These itty bitty confections are big tasty beauties decorated with perfectly rendered blue and white stripes and a fabulous blueberry flavor. Pluto’s surface is believed to be rocky, unlike these super smooth blue and white baby balls. Individually wrapped for freshness, these fruity balls shine brightly in our sugary inventory.

Most of us at CandyWarehouse grew up learning that Pluto was the ninth planet in our solar system. In 2006, that all changed. Because of its small stature in relations to its siblings Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and so forth, Pluto’s prime planet status was revoked by scientists and it was sent down to the dwarf planet class where it dwells among over 40 other similarly-sized known galaxy objects. We love tiny things with big impacts around here, and that’s why we’re over the moon about these Petite Striped Candy Balls. These itty bitty confections are big tasty beauties decorated with perfectly rendered red and white stripes and a fabulous cherry flavor. Pluto’s surface is believed to be rocky, unlike these super smooth red and white baby balls. Individually wrapped for freshness, these fruity balls shine brightly in our sugary inventory.

Most of us at CandyWarehouse grew up learning that Pluto was the ninth planet in our solar system. In 2006, that all changed. Because of its small stature in relations to its siblings Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and so forth, Pluto’s prime planet status was revoked by scientists and it was sent down to the dwarf planet class where it dwells among over 40 other similarly-sized known galaxy objects. We love tiny things with big impacts around here, and that’s why we’re over the moon about these Petite Striped Candy Balls. These itty bitty confections are big tasty beauties decorated with perfectly rendered purple and white stripes and a fabulous grape flavor. Pluto’s surface is believed to be rocky, unlike these super smooth purple and white baby balls. Individually wrapped for freshness, these fruity balls shine brightly in our sugary inventory.

2718|Green Sassy Cylinders Striped Candy: 5LB Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>Before being made obsolete by the superior disc-shaped gramophone record system, music was recorded and reproduced on wax cylinders containing special grooves. Invented in 1877, Thomas Edison’s phonograph cylinder allowed listeners to enjoy about 100 spins of a particular piece of music on these cylinders before the ""record"" wore down and the wax had to be smoothed over and imprinted with new music-playing grooves. Imagine carting boxes of cylinders around in order to listen to your favorite tunes instead of an iPod! Technology has come a long way since then, but we’re delighted to see that now cylinders can be enjoyed in a more practical and efficient way: as a delicious fruity lime candy snack. These uniquely shaped confections transmit bold lime flavor to your taste buds via thick green and white candy stripes, and each capsule of sweetness makes a strong impression on all your senses with just one gander, whiff, lick and crunch. Long-lasting hard candy goodness is kept fresh with individual wrappers, making these adorably tasty treats perfect when kept in a bowl for guests to sample. You’ll see smiles all around when you have these Sassy Cylinders on hand!<br><br> There are approximately 60 pieces per pound.<br><br><strong>Cylinder Specifications-</strong><br> Length: 1 Inch<br> Width: 1/2 Inch<br> Net Weight: 7 Grams<br> Flavor: Lime<br><br> Unit Price = $3.90/lb.<br><br> Bag contains 5 pounds of Green Sassy Cylinders Striped Candy.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Hard Candy|http://canary.dev/products/2718|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/Sassy-cylinders-green-131530-im1.jpg|19.5||Y|1|1971-11-12 14:26:48
2470|Green Sassy Suckers Striped Ball Lollipops: 100-Piece Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>In 2010, an amateur astronomer snapped a shot of the giant gaseous planet Jupiter that revealed an astronomical mystery: Jupiter has lost one of its biggest colored stripes! Made of different colored clouds, the stripes have been a mainstay since first observed in 1979, and the recent disappearance of one of the boldest belts is a dramatic galactic shift that has sky-watchers puzzled. We love Jupiter for its deep, candy-colored stripes, and that may explain why we’re over the moon about these sizable Striped Ball suckers. Lined with bright green and white stripes, these tasty candies are long-lasting snacks with a beauty that’s all their own. Curved green lines stretch across the hard candy’s surface (just like Jupiter’s banded outer layer), and meet in the centers on the left and right sides. A handy 3-inch stick makes this confection a perfect treat for getting your sweet fix on the go, and a vibrant lime taste gives you even more to get excitedly worked up over. We don’t know when or if Jupiter will get its lost stripe back, but we’ve got the perfect fruity treat to distract you while you wait!<br><br><strong>Sucker Specifications-</strong><br> Diameter: 1 Inch<br> Total Length: 4 Inches<br> Net Weight: 22 Grams<br> Flavor: Lime<br><br> Unit Price = $0.20/piece.<br><br> Bag contains 100 Green Sassy Suckers Striped Ball Lollipops.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Lollipops and Suckers|http://canary.dev/products/2470|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/sassy-pops-green-131507-im2.jpg|20.0||Y|4|1980-11-24 15:38:07

2566|Lime Sassy Spheres Green Striped Petite Candy Balls: 5LB Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>The celestial body Pluto appears bright in our night sky because its icy surface reflects the sun’s rays. Most of us at CandyWarehouse grew up learning that Pluto was the ninth planet in our solar system. In 2006, that all changed. Because of its small stature in relations to its siblings Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and so forth, Pluto’s prime planet status was revoked by scientists and it was sent down to the dwarf planet class where it dwells among over 40 other similarly-sized known galaxy objects. We love tiny things with big impacts around here, and that’s why we’re over the moon about these Petite Striped Candy Balls. These itty bitty confections are big tasty beauties decorated with perfectly rendered green and white stripes and a fabulous lime flavor. Pluto’s surface is believed to be rocky, unlike these super smooth green and white baby balls. Individually wrapped for freshness, these fruity balls shine brightly in our sugary inventory. We recommend filling up a bowl and snacking on them one by one will you stargaze tonight! <br><br> There are approximately 150 pieces per pound.<br><br><strong>Ball Dimensions-</strong><br> Diameter: 1/2 Inch<br> Net Weight: 3 Grams<br> Flavor: Lime<br><br> Unit Price = $3.90/lb.<br><br> Bag contains 5 pounds of Green Sassy Spheres Petite Striped Candy Balls.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Hard Candy|http://canary.dev/products/2566|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/sassy-spheres-petite-green-131516-im1.jpg|19.5||Y|5|1975-07-16 22:20:18

2720|Orange Sassy Cylinders Striped Candy: 5LB Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>Before being made obsolete by the superior disc-shaped gramophone record system, music was recorded and reproduced on wax cylinders containing special grooves. Invented in 1877, Thomas Edison’s phonograph cylinder allowed listeners to enjoy about 100 spins of a particular piece of music on these cylinders before the ""record"" wore down and the wax had to be smoothed over and imprinted with new music-playing grooves. Imagine carting boxes of cylinders around in order to listen to your favorite tunes instead of an iPod! Technology has come a long way since then, but we’re delighted to see that now cylinders can be enjoyed in a more practical and efficient way: as a delicious fruity orange candy snack. These uniquely shaped confections transmit bold orange flavor to your taste buds via thick orange and white candy stripes, and each capsule of sweetness makes a strong impression on all your senses with just one gander, whiff, lick and crunch. Long-lasting hard candy goodness is kept fresh with individual wrappers, making these adorably tasty treats perfect when kept in a bowl for guests to sample. You’ll see smiles all around when you have these Sassy Cylinders on hand!<br><br> There are approximately 60 pieces per pound.<br><br><strong>Cylinder Specifications-</strong><br> Length: 1 Inch<br> Width: 1/2 Inch<br> Net Weight: 7 Grams<br> Flavor: Orange<br><br> Unit Price = $3.90/lb.<br><br> Bag contains 5 pounds of Orange Sassy Cylinders Striped Candy.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Hard Candy|http://canary.dev/products/2720|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/sassy-cylinders-orange-131528-im.jpg|19.5||Y|1|1970-01-12 16:58:31

2568|Orange Sassy Spheres Orange Striped Petite Candy Balls: 5LB Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>The celestial body Pluto appears bright in our night sky because its icy surface reflects the sun’s rays. Most of us at CandyWarehouse grew up learning that Pluto was the ninth planet in our solar system. In 2006, that all changed. Because of its small stature in relations to its siblings Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and so forth, Pluto’s prime planet status was revoked by scientists and it was sent down to the dwarf planet class where it dwells among over 40 other similarly-sized known galaxy objects. We love tiny things with big impacts around here, and that’s why we’re over the moon about these Petite Striped Candy Balls. These itty bitty confections are big tasty beauties decorated with perfectly rendered orange and white stripes and a fabulous orange flavor. Pluto’s surface is believed to be rocky, unlike these super smooth orange and white baby balls. Individually wrapped for freshness, these fruity balls shine brightly in our sugary inventory. We recommend filling up a bowl and snacking on them one by one will you stargaze tonight!<br><br> There are approximately 150 pieces per pound.<br><br><strong>Ball Specifications-</strong><br> Diameter: 1/2 Inch<br> Net Weight: 3 Grams<br> Flavor: Orange<br><br> Unit Price = $3.90/lb.<br><br> Bag contains 5 pounds of Orange Sassy Spheres Petite Striped Candy Balls.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Hard Candy|http://canary.dev/products/2568|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/sassy-spheres-petite-orange-131513-im.jpg|19.5||Y|5|1986-06-13 03:11:28
2472|Orange Sassy Suckers Striped Ball Lollipops: 100-Piece Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>In 2010, an amateur astronomer snapped a shot of the giant gaseous planet Jupiter that revealed an astronomical mystery: Jupiter has lost one of its biggest colored stripes! Made of different colored clouds, the stripes have been a mainstay since first observed in 1979, and the recent disappearance of one of the boldest belts is a dramatic galactic shift that has sky-watchers puzzled. We love Jupiter for its deep, candy-colored stripes, and that may explain why we’re over the moon about these sizable striped ball suckers. Lined with bright orange and white stripes, these tasty candies are long-lasting snacks with a beauty that’s all their own. Curved orange lines stretch across the hard candy’s surface (just like Jupiter’s banded outer layer), and meet in the centers on the left and right sides. A handy 3-inch stick makes this confection a perfect treat for getting your sweet fix on the go, and a vibrant orange taste gives you even more to get excitedly worked up over. We don’t know when or if Jupiter will get its lost stripe back, but we’ve got the perfect fruity treat to distract you while you wait!<br><br><strong>Sucker Specifications-</strong><br> Diameter: 1 Inch<br> Total Length: 4 Inches<br> Net Weight: 22 Grams<br> Flavor: Orange<br><br> Unit Price = $0.20/piece.<br><br> Bag contains 100 Orange Sassy Suckers Striped Ball Lollipops.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Lollipops and Suckers|http://canary.dev/products/2472|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/Sassy-pops-orange-131506-im2.jpg|20.0||Y|5|1998-07-31 04:18:09

2715|Pink Sassy Cylinders Striped Candy: 5LB Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>Before being made obsolete by the superior disc-shaped gramophone record system, music was recorded and reproduced on wax cylinders containing special grooves. Invented in 1877, Thomas Edison’s phonograph cylinder allowed listeners to enjoy about 100 spins of a particular piece of music on these cylinders before the ""record"" wore down and the wax had to be smoothed over and imprinted with new music-playing grooves. Imagine carting boxes of cylinders around in order to listen to your favorite tunes instead of an iPod! Technology has come a long way since then, but we’re delighted to see that now cylinders can be enjoyed in a more practical and efficient way: as a delicious fruity strawberry candy snack. These uniquely shaped confections transmit bold strawberry flavor to your taste buds via thick pink and white candy stripes, and each capsule of sweetness makes a strong impression on all your senses with just one gander, whiff, lick and crunch. Long-lasting hard candy goodness is kept fresh with individual wrappers, making these adorably tasty treats perfect when kept in a bowl for guests to sample. You’ll see smiles all around when you have these Sassy Cylinders on hand!<br><br> There are approximately 60 pieces per pound.<br><br><strong>Cylinder Specifications-</strong><br> Length: 1 Inch<br> Width: 1/2 Inch<br> Net Weight: 7 Grams<br> Flavor: Strawberry<br><br> Unit Price = $3.90/lb.<br><br> Bag contains 5 pounds of Pink Sassy Cylinders Striped Candy.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Hard Candy|http://canary.dev/products/2715|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/sassy-cylinders-pink-131533-im1.jpg|19.5||Y|5|1974-08-10 23:31:33
2570|Pink Sassy Suckers Petite Striped Ball Lollipops: 400-Piece Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>If you’ve ever taken Astronomy 101, you learned that acclaimed comet hunter Charles Messier catalogued a number of bright and colored celestial star objects in late 1700s France that bear his name. Arguably the most famous Messier object is the Pleiades, or the Seven Sisters, visible within the constellation Taurus. This globular cluster contains a handful of very young, hot stars that glow in a beautiful blue hue. Like the Pleiades, these tiny Striped Ball Lollipops are small, vibrantly colored, and make a big impact on the scene with their flashy look and potent fruity taste. Thick pink and white stripes stretch happily across the baby pop’s spherical surface, invisibly tied on either side of the hard candy bit. A half-inch sized strawberry-flavored sphere sits atop a stick that measures a little over an inch and a half, making this delightful confection the perfect individual topper to cupcakes, or en masse as an ideal adornment for a gourmet cake for a circus or boardwalk-themed birthday party. This tiny, two-bite pink and white wrapped treat is so tasty, you won’t be able to keep them within your sights for long. They taste too good!<br><br><strong>Sucker Specifications-</strong><br> Diameter: 1/2 Inch<br> Total Length: 2.5 Inches<br> Net Weight: 5 Grams<br> Flavor: Strawberry<br><br> Unit Price = $0.05/piece.<br><br> Bag contains 400 Pink Sassy Suckers Petite Striped Ball Lollipops.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Little Candy|http://canary.dev/products/2570|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/sassy-petite-pops-pink-131504-im2.jpg|20.0||Y|3|1973-04-04 11:12:01
2467|Pink Sassy Suckers Striped Ball Lollipops: 100-Piece Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>In 2010, an amateur astronomer snapped a shot of the giant gaseous planet Jupiter that revealed an astronomical mystery: Jupiter has lost one of its biggest colored stripes! Made of different colored clouds, the stripes have been a mainstay since first observed in 1979, and the recent disappearance of one of the boldest belts is a dramatic galactic shift that has sky-watchers puzzled. We love Jupiter for its deep, candy-colored stripes, and that may explain why we’re over the moon about these sizable Striped Ball suckers. Lined with bright pink and white stripes, these tasty candies are long-lasting snacks with a beauty that’s all their own. Curved pink lines stretch across the hard candy’s surface (just like Jupiter’s banded outer layer), and meet in the centers on the left and right sides. A handy 3-inch stick makes this confection a perfect treat for getting your sweet fix on the go, and a succulent strawberry taste gives you even more to get excitedly worked up over. We don’t know when or if Jupiter will get its lost stripe back, but we’ve got the perfect fruity treat to distract you while you wait!<br><br><strong>Sucker Specifications-</strong><br> Diameter: 1 Inch<br> Total Length: 4 Inches<br> Net Weight: 22 Grams<br> Flavor: Strawberry<br><br> Unit Price = $0.20/piece.<br><br> Bag contains 100 Pink Sassy Suckers Striped Ball Lollipops.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Lollipops and Suckers|http://canary.dev/products/2467|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/sassy-pops-pink-131511-im2.jpg|20.0||Y|2|2010-03-30 21:39:29

2716|Purple Sassy Cylinders Striped Candy: 5LB Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>Before being made obsolete by the superior disc-shaped gramophone record system, music was recorded and reproduced on wax cylinders containing special grooves. Invented in 1877, Thomas Edison’s phonograph cylinder allowed listeners to enjoy about 100 spins of a particular piece of music on these cylinders before the ""record"" wore down and the wax had to be smoothed over and imprinted with new music-playing grooves. Imagine carting boxes of cylinders around in order to listen to your favorite tunes instead of an iPod! Technology has come a long way since then, but we’re delighted to see that now cylinders can be enjoyed in a more practical and efficient way: as a delicious fruity grape candy snack. These uniquely shaped confections transmit bold grape flavor to your taste buds via thick purple and white candy stripes, and each capsule of sweetness makes a strong impression on all your senses with just one gander, whiff, lick and crunch. Long-lasting hard candy goodness is kept fresh with individual wrappers, making these adorably tasty treats perfect when kept in a bowl for guests to sample. You’ll see smiles all around when you have these Sassy Cylinders on hand!<br><br> There are approximately 60 pieces per pound.<br><br><strong>Cylinder Specifications-</strong><br> Length: 1 Inch<br> Width: 1/2 Inch<br> Net Weight: 7 Grams<br> Flavor: Grape<br><br> Unit Price = $3.90/lb.<br><br> Bag contains 5 pounds of Purple Sassy Cylinders Striped Candy.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Hard Candy|http://canary.dev/products/2716|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/sassy-cylinders-purple-131532-im.jpg|19.5||Y|4|1992-08-29 21:34:00
2571|Purple Sassy Suckers Petite Striped Ball Lollipops: 400-Piece Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>If you’ve ever taken Astronomy 101, you learned that acclaimed comet hunter Charles Messier catalogued a number of bright and colored celestial star objects in late 1700s France that bear his name. Arguably the most famous Messier object is the Pleiades, or the Seven Sisters, visible within the constellation Taurus. This globular cluster contains a handful of very young, hot stars that glow in a beautiful blue hue. Like the Pleiades, these tiny Striped Ball Lollipops are small, vibrantly colored, and make a big impact on the scene with their flashy look and potent fruity taste. Thick purple and white stripes stretch happily across the baby pop’s spherical surface, invisibly tied on either side of the hard candy bit. A half-inch sized grape-flavored sphere sits atop a stick that measures a little over an inch and a half, making this delightful confection the perfect individual topper to cupcakes, or en masse as an ideal adornment for a gourmet cake for a circus or boardwalk-themed birthday party. This tiny, two-bite purple and white wrapped treat is so tasty, you won’t be able to keep them within your sights for long. They taste too good!<br><br><strong>Sucker Specifications-</strong><br> Diameter: 1/2 Inch<br> Total Length: 2.5 Inches<br> Net Weight: 5 Grams<br> Flavor: Grape<br><br> Unit Price = $0.05/piece.<br><br> Bag contains 400 Purple Sassy Suckers Petite Striped Ball Lollipops.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Little Candy|http://canary.dev/products/2571|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/sassy-petite-pops-purple-131503-im2.jpg|20.0||Y|4|2008-06-17 17:49:15
2468|Purple Sassy Suckers Striped Ball Lollipops: 100-Piece Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>In 2010, an amateur astronomer snapped a shot of the giant gaseous planet Jupiter that revealed an astronomical mystery: Jupiter has lost one of its biggest colored stripes! Made of different colored clouds, the stripes have been a mainstay since first observed in 1979, and the recent disappearance of one of the boldest belts is a dramatic galactic shift that has sky-watchers puzzled. We love Jupiter for its deep, candy-colored stripes, and that may explain why we’re over the moon about these sizable Striped Ball suckers. Lined with bright purple and white stripes, these tasty candies are long-lasting snacks with a beauty that’s all their own. Curved purple lines stretch across the hard candy’s surface (just like Jupiter’s banded outer layer), and meet in the centers on the left and right sides. A handy 3-inch stick makes this confection a perfect treat for getting your sweet fix on the go, and a vibrant grape taste gives you even more to get excitedly worked up over. We don’t know when or if Jupiter will get its lost stripe back, but we’ve got the perfect fruity treat to distract you while you wait!<br><br><strong>Sucker Specifications-</strong><br> Diameter: 1 Inch<br> Total Length: 4 Inches<br> Net Weight: 22 Grams<br> Flavor: Grape<br><br> Unit Price = $0.20/piece.<br><br> Bag contains 100 Purple Sassy Suckers Striped Ball Lollipops.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Lollipops and Suckers|http://canary.dev/products/2468|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/sassy-pops-purple-131510-im2.jpg|20.0||Y|1|2000-07-05 01:20:15

2719|Yellow Sassy Cylinders Striped Candy: 5LB Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>Before being made obsolete by the superior disc-shaped gramophone record system, music was recorded and reproduced on wax cylinders containing special grooves. Invented in 1877, Thomas Edison’s phonograph cylinder allowed listeners to enjoy about 100 spins of a particular piece of music on these cylinders before the ""record"" wore down and the wax had to be smoothed over and imprinted with new music-playing grooves. Imagine carting boxes of cylinders around in order to listen to your favorite tunes instead of an iPod! Technology has come a long way since then, but we’re delighted to see that now cylinders can be enjoyed in a more practical and efficient way: as a delicious fruity banana candy snack. These uniquely shaped confections transmit bold banana flavor to your taste buds via thick yellow and white candy stripes, and each capsule of sweetness makes a strong impression on all your senses with just one gander, whiff, lick and crunch. Long-lasting hard candy goodness is kept fresh with individual wrappers, making these adorably tasty treats perfect when kept in a bowl for guests to sample. You’ll see smiles all around when you have these Sassy Cylinders on hand!<br><br> There are approximately 60 pieces per pound.<br><br><strong>Cylinder Specifications-</strong><br> Length: 1 Inch<br> Width: 1/2 Inch<br> Net Weight: 7 Grams<br> Flavor: Banana<br><br> Unit Price = $3.90/lb.<br><br> Bag contains 5 pounds of Yellow Sassy Cylinders Striped Candy.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Hard Candy|http://canary.dev/products/2719|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/sassy-cylinders-yellow-131529-im.jpg|19.5||Y|1|2000-08-07 14:53:29
2471|Yellow Sassy Suckers Striped Ball Lollipops: 100-Piece Bag|"<br><p id=""longDescription""></p> <div>In 2010, an amateur astronomer snapped a shot of the giant gaseous planet Jupiter that revealed an astronomical mystery: Jupiter has lost one of its biggest colored stripes! Made of different colored clouds, the stripes have been a mainstay since first observed in 1979, and the recent disappearance of one of the boldest belts is a dramatic galactic shift that has sky-watchers puzzled. We love Jupiter for its deep, candy-colored stripes, and that may explain why we’re over the moon about these sizable Striped Ball suckers. Lined with bright yellow and white stripes, these tasty candies are long-lasting snacks with a beauty that’s all their own. Curved yellow lines stretch across the hard candy’s surface (just like Jupiter’s banded outer layer), and meet in the centers on the left and right sides. A handy 3-inch stick makes this confection a perfect treat for getting your sweet fix on the go, and a vibrant banana taste gives you even more to get excitedly worked up over. We don’t know when or if Jupiter will get its lost stripe back, but we’ve got the perfect fruity treat to distract you while you wait!<br><br><strong>Sucker Specifications-</strong><br> Diameter: 1 Inch<br> Total Length: 4 Inches<br> Net Weight: 22 Grams<br> Flavor: Banana<br><br> Unit Price = $0.20/piece.<br><br> Bag contains 100 Yellow Sassy Suckers Striped Ball Lollipops.<br><br> Shipping Weight ~ 6 lbs.</div>"|Canary|Lollipops and Suckers|http://canary.dev/products/2471|http://www.candywarehouse.com//assets/item/regular/Sassy-pops-yellow-131508-im2.jpg|20.0||Y|2|1989-09-29 22:38:51

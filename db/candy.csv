<div>American movie theaters of the 1930s were designed with such opulence that they rivaled the sophistication of European opera houses across the pond. Owners feared that selling snacks to movie-goers would dirty the aisles and cheapen the experience of viewing in these palaces filled with pricey antiques, marble columns, crystal chandeliers and perfume-scented common spaces. It wasn't until the Great Depression forced owners to seek out new sources of revenue that candies we know and love today were offered up for purchase to patrons. Today we celebrate the candies in this mix as iconic movie theater candy.

Pink Sassy Suckers Striped Ball Lollipops: 100-Piece Bag|"
   
        <br><p id=""longDescription""></p>
<div>In 2010, an amateur astronomer snapped a shot of the giant gaseous planet Jupiter that revealed an astronomical mystery: Jupiter has lost one of its biggest colored stripes! Made of different colored clouds, the stripes have been a mainstay since first observed in 1979, and the recent disappearance of one of the boldest belts is a dramatic galactic shift that has sky-watchers puzzled. We love Jupiter for its deep, candy-colored stripes, and that may explain why we’re over the moon about these sizable Striped Ball suckers. Lined with bright pink and white stripes, these tasty candies are long-lasting snacks with a beauty that’s all their own. Curved pink lines stretch across the hard candy’s surface (just like Jupiter’s banded outer layer), and meet in the centers on the left and right sides. A handy 3-inch stick makes this confection a perfect treat for getting your sweet fix on the go, and a succulent strawberry taste gives you even more to get excitedly worked up over. We don’t know when or if Jupiter will get its lost stripe back, but we’ve got the perfect fruity treat to distract you while you wait!<br><br><strong>Sucker Specifications-</strong><br>

<div>In 2010, an amateur astronomer snapped a shot of the giant gaseous planet Jupiter that revealed an astronomical mystery: Jupiter has lost one of its biggest colored stripes! Made of different colored clouds, the stripes have been a mainstay since first observed in 1979, and the recent disappearance of one of the boldest belts is a dramatic galactic shift that has sky-watchers puzzled. We love Jupiter for its deep, candy-colored stripes, and that may explain why we’re over the moon about these sizable Striped Ball suckers. Lined with bright purple and white stripes, these tasty candies are long-lasting snacks with a beauty that’s all their own. Curved purple lines stretch across the hard candy’s surface (just like Jupiter’s banded outer layer), and meet in the centers on the left and right sides. A handy 3-inch stick makes this confection a perfect treat for getting your sweet fix on the go, and a vibrant grape taste gives you even more to get excitedly worked up over. We don’t know when or if Jupiter will get its lost stripe back, but we’ve got the perfect fruity treat to distract you while you wait!<br><br><strong>Sucker Specifications-</strong><br>

<div>French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence... and these purple-striped Sticklettes are inspired by that same excellence.

On the palate, these Sticklettes have that perfect balance between sugary hard candy snap and sun-ripened grape-flavored savor.  Paired well with poultry, game or a box of Razzles, Sticklettes are the perfect addition to any dinner party.  Just don’t try to make grappa out of the wrappers.<br><br><b>Stick Specifications-</b><br>

Thick pink and white stripes stretch happily across the baby pop’s spherical surface, invisibly tied on either side of the hard candy bit.

Most of us at CandyWarehouse grew up learning that Pluto was the ninth planet in our solar system. In 2006, that all changed. Because of its small stature in relations to its siblings Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and so forth, Pluto’s prime planet status was revoked by scientists and it was sent down to the dwarf planet class where it dwells among over 40 other similarly-sized known galaxy objects. We love tiny things with big impacts around here, and that’s why we’re over the moon about these Petite Striped Candy Balls. These itty bitty confections are big tasty beauties decorated with perfectly rendered pink and white stripes and a fabulous strawberry flavor.

Most of us at CandyWarehouse grew up learning that Pluto was the ninth planet in our solar system. In 2006, that all changed. Because of its small stature in relations to its siblings Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and so forth, Pluto’s prime planet status was revoked by scientists and it was sent down to the dwarf planet class where it dwells among over 40 other similarly-sized known galaxy objects. We love tiny things with big impacts around here, and that’s why we’re over the moon about these Petite Striped Candy Balls. These itty bitty confections are big tasty beauties decorated with perfectly rendered blue and white stripes and a fabulous blueberry flavor. Pluto’s surface is believed to be rocky, unlike these super smooth blue and white baby balls. Individually wrapped for freshness, these fruity balls shine brightly in our sugary inventory. We recommend filling up a bowl and snacking on them one by one will you stargaze tonight!<br><br>

        <br><p id=""longDescription""></p>
<div>Before being made obsolete by the superior disc-shaped gramophone record system, music was recorded and reproduced on wax cylinders containing special grooves. Invented in 1877, Thomas Edison’s phonograph cylinder allowed listeners to enjoy about 100 spins of a particular piece of music on these cylinders before the ""record"" wore down and the wax had to be smoothed over and imprinted with new music-playing grooves. Imagine carting boxes of cylinders around in order to listen to your favorite tunes instead of an iPod! Technology has come a long way since then, but we’re delighted to see that now cylinders can be enjoyed in a more practical and efficient way: as a delicious fruity strawberry candy snack. These uniquely shaped confections transmit bold strawberry flavor to your taste buds via thick pink and white candy stripes, and each capsule of sweetness makes a strong impression on all your senses with just one gander, whiff, lick and crunch. Long-lasting hard candy goodness is kept fresh with individual wrappers, making these adorably tasty treats perfect when kept in a bowl for guests to sample. You’ll see smiles all around when you have these Sassy Cylinders on hand!<br><br>

Sushi Candy Pops: 40-Piece Bag|"
   
        <br><p id=""longDescription""></p>
<div>Originally a street food sold on the waterfront at the beginning of the 19th century when Tokyo was still known as Edo, the sushi we know and love today became popular throughout Japan after the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 as out-of-work sushi chefs dispersed all over Japan in search of work. Japanese businesses and sushi restaurants started cropping up in the United States in the late 1970s, and it took the introduction of the California roll to make American diners finally fall in love with the new raw fish-focused cuisine.<br><br>
Today, every sushi fan in America has a few favorite rolls, and this roundup of darling sushi-shaped confections features several of the heaviest-hitters on sushi menus all over the world. Ebi, Tamago, Toro, Ikura, Maguro, and Futomaki are charming sugar facsimiles of the original raw fish snacks, wrapped in cellophane bearing Japanese characters and tied with happy-go-lucky pipe cleaners. Fashioned in vibrant corresponding colors atop lumpy white candy that looks just like short grain rice, these flavorful suckers are impaled on lengthy, clear plastic spears that make it easy to display them or use them as swizzle sticks at cocktail parties for the young and hip. Impossible to resist, you might just deem these sweet treats too-cute-to-eat.<br><br><strong>Sucker Specifications-</strong><br>

Batman 9-Inch Tall Gumball Dispenser|"
   
        <br><p id=""longDescription""></p>
<div>Each Batman movie that Christopher Nolan created centers on a theme that can be summed up in one word. Recently the filmmaker was quoted as stating that 2005's <em>Batman Begins</em> is about ""fear"" while 2008's <em>The Dark Knight</em> operates with ""chaos,"" and 2012's <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> focuses on ""pain."" Pretty weighty subjects, but no one ever characterized Nolan's noir-ish vision of this crime-fighter on the big screen as being light and breezy. We wouldn't change a thing about the movies, but we're thankful there are fun ways to keep the Man in Black's adventures alive long after his story ends--this cool Batman-themed gumball dispenser is one sweet way. Boldly decorated boxes with images of the Marvel Comics superhero contain a modern iteration of the iconic gumball machines of old. Perfect for a bookshelf or at the corner of a desk to ensure convenient snacking while you study, each clear-topped container features Batman's daunting costumed figure as he confidently protects the tiny treats inside. Though they come equipped with a bag of gumballs in classic hues to get you started, you can refill your container with any small candies of your choice by removing the easy-to-open cap at the top of each dispenser. Buy one as a gift for pint-sized crime-fighters-in-training in your life, or keep one as a collectible for yourself! <br><strong><br>

<div>In 2013, British actor Henry Cavill is slated to power up to assume the role as the first non-American actor to play Clark Kent/Superman in<em> Man of Steel</em>. We're so excited to see the finished product on the big screen! We want you to be as hyped up as we are, and the best way to do that is to start celebrating the famed DC Comics superhero with sweet candy toys like this refillable red Gumball Dispenser. A modern version of the iconic gumball machines of old, this shiny container offers endlessly sweet snacking opportunities. A big bag of classically colored gumballs included in a brightly-colored Superman-themed box starts you off, and a many-muscled image of Superman guards the goodies it holds inside the transparent container top. A small cap makes it easy to refill these dispensers with any small candies that you fancy once the first batch is gone.
